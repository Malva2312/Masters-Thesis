\section{Population and sampling}
    %% Population and sampling
    The lung nodule classification study will use a population of CT images from publicly available and clinically validated datasets, generally used for this purpose. We will fully trust in their assignment of labels (benign/malignant) to conduct experiments. 
    % LIDC-IDRI as example
    
    To retrieve insights into the characteristics and quality of the data we will submit it to an analysis and provide some visualization for easier interpretation. Computing and summarizing statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for nodule size, patient demographics, and other clinical variables and distribution of classifications in the used datasets to evaluate balance and ascertain the need to perform sampling techniques. For each dataset selected, pre-processing will be carried out in order to improve the quality of the images: ensuring uniformity if necessary, such as applying resampling techniques, and removing, for example, noise and other irrelevant information.
    
    In order to proceed with the experimentation phase, the data will be randomly divided into training and test sets, with the aim of carrying out evaluations afterward. This division will mitigate possible over-fitting effects.
        
\section{Evaluation Strategy}
Each combination will be evaluated using standardized cross-validation protocols to ensure robust and generalizable results. Detailed logs of the performance metrics for each run will be maintained to enable comprehensive comparative analysis.
Accuracy provides an overall measure of the model’s correctness by quantifying the proportion of correctly classified cases. However, accuracy alone can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, where the majority class dominates predictions. Sensitivity (recall) is essential in this context, as it measures the model's ability to correctly identify malignant nodules, ensuring minimal false negatives, which is critical for early cancer detection and patient prognosis. Conversely, specificity assesses the model’s capability to correctly classify benign nodules, reducing false positives and preventing unnecessary invasive procedures. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's discriminative ability across various decision thresholds, balancing sensitivity and specificity.

\section{Deep-Learning Selection}
The first step in the research is to detect and manifest deep learning models that are the best of the best and specifically designed for the classification of pulmonary nodules in CT images. The primary target is to create a baseline for performance measurements that are to be taken into consideration. The retrieve models will be subject of a defined evaluation and ranked based on performance. We will use the best performing models to combine them with additional methods and features. 

\section{Shallow Extractors}
In parallel with deep learning, shallow feature extractors are employed to capture complementary visual and textural information about pulmonary nodules. This stage aims to identify and implement diverse extractors that contribute unique feature sets. We will select the most used extractors for texture, shape, moment-based, gradient-based, and hierarchical features used in the state of the art.
The objective is to use them in the same dataset used for deep learning methods and ensuring compatibility with fusion techniques.

\section{Fusion Methods}
The integration of deep learning outputs with shallow feature sets is crucial for leveraging the strengths of both approaches. To achieve this, state-of-the-art fusion techniques will be examined and implemented. Fusion can be applied at two primary levels: decision-level and feature-level. Decision-level fusion combines predictions from multiple models or classifiers using techniques such as weighted voting, majority voting (MAX-VOTE), and prediction averaging, allowing the ensemble of predictions to refine the overall accuracy. On the other hand, feature-level fusion involves concatenating or averaging feature vectors from deep learning models and shallow extractors, often with dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to manage high-dimensional data. These techniques will be implemented in a modular framework, ensuring compatibility with various model configurations.

\section{Experimentation}
The experimentation phase is designed to systematically evaluate the performance of different combinations of deep learning models, shallow feature extractors, and fusion techniques in classifying pulmonary nodules. A flexible workflow will be developed to facilitate the testing of these combinations. This workflow begins by selecting one of the three top-performing deep learning models identified earlier, followed by choosing one to all five shallow feature extractors. The selected outputs are then combined using one of the chosen fusion methods. The pipeline processes the input CT images, extracts features, applies fusion, and trains the combined model. For each configuration, the model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, area under the curve (AUC), and false-positive rate (FPR).
This systematic approach ensures that all potential interactions between deep learning models, shallow feature extractors, and fusion techniques are explored. The goal is to identify the configurations that deliver the highest classification accuracy, outperforming both standalone deep learning models and traditional classifiers. The experimental results will provide valuable insights into the synergies between deep and shallow methods, establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in pulmonary nodule classification.
