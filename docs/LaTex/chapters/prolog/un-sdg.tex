\chapter*{UN Sustainable Development Goals} 
\label{chap:UnitedNations}

The United Nations \acp{sdg} provide a global framework to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. 
There are 17 goals addressing the world's most pressing challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice~\cite{united_nations_17_2015}.

This research contributes to \ac{sdg} 3 by developing and validating information fusion-based models that combine deep and shallow features for lung cancer characterization. The aim of studying these models is to improve early diagnosis, decrease mortality, and support more informed clinical decision-making. This work aligns with health equity by promoting access to reliable diagnostic tools, supporting global well-being commitments, and reducing health disparities.

The specific Sustainable Development Goals referenced in this work include:

\begin{description}
    \item [\ac{sdg} 3] Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
\end{description}
