  abstract={Detecting and identifying malignant nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the early diagnosis and timely treatment of lung cancer, which can greatly reduce the number of deaths worldwide. In view of the existing methods in pulmonary nodule diagnosis, the importance of clinical radiological structured data (laboratory examination, radiological data) is ignored for the accuracy judgment of patients’ condition. Hence, a multi-modal fusion multi-branch classification network is constructed to detect and classify pulmonary nodules in this work: (1) Radiological data of pulmonary nodules are used to construct structured features of length 9. (2) A multi-branch fusion-based effective attention mechanism network is designed for 3D CT Patch unstructured data, which uses 3D ECA-ResNet to dynamically adjust the extracted features. In addition, feature maps with different receptive fields from multi-layer are fully fused to obtain representative multi-scale unstructured features. (3) Multi-modal feature fusion of structured data and unstructured data is performed to distinguish benign and malignant nodules. Numerous experimental results show that this advanced network can effectively classify the benign and malignant pulmonary nodules for clinical diagnosis, which achieves the highest accuracy (94.89%), sensitivity (94.91%), and F1-score (94.65%) and lowest false positive rate (5.55%).},

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic review of the literature focused on the lung nodule detection in chest computed tomography (CT) images. Manual detection of lung nodules by the radiologist is a sequential and time-consuming process. The detection is subjective and depends on the radiologist’s experiences. Owing to the variation in shapes and appearances of a lung nodule, it is very difficult to identify the proper location of the nodule from a huge number of slices generated by the CT scanner. Small nodules (<10mm in diameter) may be missed by this manual detection process. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system acts as a “second opinion” for the radiologists, by making final decision quickly with higher accuracy and greater confidence. The goal of this survey work is to present the current state of the artworks and their progress towards lung nodule detection to the researchers and readers in this domain. This review paper has covered the published works from 2009 to April 2018. Different nodule detection approaches are described elaborately in this work. Recently, it is observed that deep learning (DL)-based approaches are applied extensively for nodule detection and characterization. Therefore, emphasis has been given to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL approaches by describing different CNN-based networks.},

  abstract={Lung CAD system can provide auxiliary third-party opinions for doctors, improve the accuracy of lung nodule recognition. The selection and fusion of nodule features and the advancement of recognition algorithms are crucial improving lung CAD systems. Based on the HDL model, this paper mainly focuses on the three key algorithms of feature extraction, feature fusion and nodule recognition of lung CAD system. First, CBAM is embedded into VGG16 and VGG19, and feature extraction models AE-VGG16 and AE-VGG19 are constructed, so that the network can pay more attention to the key feature information in nodule description. Then, feature dimensionality reduction based on PCA and feature fusion based on CCA are sequentially performed on the extracted depth features to obtain low-dimensional fusion features. Finally, the fusion features are input into the proposed MKL-SVM-IPSO model based on the improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to speed up the training speed, get the global optimal parameter group. The public dataset LUNA16 was selected for the experiment. The results show that the accuracy of lung nodule recognition of the proposed lung CAD system can reach 99.56%, and the sensitivity and F1-score can reach 99.3% and 0.9965, respectively, which can reduce the possibility of false detection and missed detection of nodules.},

Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications for lung nodules continues to grow among radiologists, particularly with the expanding eligibility criteria and clinical utilization of lung cancer screening CT. AI has been heavily investigated for detecting and characterizing lung nodules and for guiding prognostic assessment. AI tools have also been used for image postprocessing (e.g., rib suppression on radiography or vessel suppression on CT) and for noninterpretive aspects of reporting and workflow, including management of nodule follow-up. Despite growing interest in and rapid development of AI tools and FDA approval of AI tools for pulmonary nodule evaluation, integration into clinical practice has been limited. Challenges to clinical adoption have included concerns about generalizability, regulatory issues, technical hurdles in implementation, and human skepticism. Further validation of AI tools for clinical use and demonstration of benefit in terms of patient-oriented outcomes also are needed. This article provides an overview of potential applications of AI tools in the imaging evaluation of lung nodules and discusses the challenges faced by practices interested in clinical implementation of such tools.},

               appearance features modeled using the higher order Markov Gibbs
               random field model that has the ability to describe the spatial
               inhomogeneities inside the lung nodule and (2) geometric
               features that describe the shape geometry of the lung nodules.
               The novelty of this article is to accurately model the

  abstract={Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths due to its aggressive nature and delayed detections at advanced stages. Early detection of lung cancer is very important for the survival of an individual, and is a significant challenging problem. Generally, chest radiographs (X-ray) and computed tomography (CT) scans are used initially for the diagnosis of the malignant nodules; however, the possible existence of benign nodules leads to erroneous decisions. At early stages, the benign and the malignant nodules show very close resemblance to each other. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model with multiple strategies is proposed for the precise diagnosis of the malignant nodules. Due to the recent achievements of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image analysis, we have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed link network (CMixNet) architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively. Nodule detections were performed through faster R-CNN on efficiently-learned features from CMixNet and U-Net like encoder-decoder architecture. Classification of the nodules was performed through a gradient boosting machine (GBM) on the learned features from the designed 3D CMixNet structure. To reduce false positives and misdiagnosis results due to different types of errors, the final decision was performed in connection with physiological symptoms and clinical biomarkers. With the advent of the internet of things (IoT) and electro-medical technology, wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide continuous monitoring of patients, which helps in diagnosis of chronic diseases-especially metastatic cancers. The deep learning model for nodules' detection and classification, combined with clinical factors, helps in the reduction of misdiagnosis and false positive (FP) results in early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed system was evaluated on LIDC-IDRI datasets in the form of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (91%), and better results were obatined compared to the existing methods.},

abstract = {As cancer with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world, lung cancer is characterized by pulmonary nodules in the early stage. The detection of pulmonary nodules is an important method for the early detection of lung cancer, which can greatly improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients. However, the accuracy of conventional detection methods for lung nodules is low. With the development of medical imaging technology, deep learning plays an increasingly important role in medical image detection, and pulmonary nodules can be accurately detected by CT images. Based on the above, a pulmonary nodule detection method based on deep learning is proposed. In the candidate nodule detection stage, the multiscale features and Faster R-CNN, a general-purpose detection framework based on deep learning, were combined together to improve the detection of small-sized lung nodules. In the false-positive nodule filtration stage, a 3D convolutional neural network based on multiscale fusion is designed to reduce false-positive nodules. The experiment results show that the candidate nodule detection model based on Faster R-CNN integrating multiscale features has achieved a sensitivity of 98.6\%, 10\% higher than that of the other single-scale model, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 90.5\% at the level of 4 false-positive nodules per scan, and the CPM score reached 0.829. The results are higher than methods in other works of literature. It can be seen that the detection method of pulmonary nodules based on multiscale fusion has a higher detection rate for small nodules and improves the classification performance of true and false-positive pulmonary nodules. This will help doctors when making a lung cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract={Lung cancer has one of the highest mortalities of all cancers. According to the National Lung Screening Trial, patients who underwent low-dose computed tomography (CT) scanning once a year for 3 years showed a 20% decline in lung cancer mortality. To further improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology shows great potential. In this paper, we summarize existing CAD approaches applying deep learning to CT scan data for pre-processing, lung segmentation, false positive reduction, lung nodule detection, segmentation, classification and retrieval. Selected papers are drawn from academic journals and conferences up to November 2020. We discuss the development of deep learning, describe several important aspects of lung nodule CAD systems and assess the performance of the selected studies on various datasets, which include LIDC-IDRI, LUNA16, LIDC, DSB2017, NLST, TianChi, and ELCAP. Overall, in the detection studies reviewed, the sensitivity of these techniques is found to range from 61.61% to 98.10%, and the value of the FPs per scan is between 0.125 and 32. In the selected classification studies, the accuracy ranges from 75.01% to 97.58%. The precision of the selected retrieval studies is between 71.43% and 87.29%. Based on performance, deep learning based CAD technologies for detection and classification of pulmonary nodules achieve satisfactory results. However, there are still many challenges and limitations remaining including over-fitting, lack of interpretability and insufficient annotated data. This review helps researchers and radiologists to better understand CAD technology for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, classification and retrieval. We summarize the performance of current techniques, consider the challenges, and propose directions for future high-impact research.},

Here, we propose a method of detection based on PET/CT that can differentiate malignant and benign SPNs with few false-positives.   Method Our proposed method combines the features of positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). A dynamic threshold segmentation method was used to identify lung parenchyma in CT images and suspicious areas in PET images. Then, an improved watershed method was used to mark suspicious areas on the CT image. Next, the support vector machine (SVM) method was used to classify SPNs based on textural features of CT images and metabolic features of PET images to validate the proposed method.   Results Our proposed method was more efficient than traditional methods and methods based on the CT or PET features alone (sensitivity 95.6%; average of 2.9 false positives per scan).},

Participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose CT (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). Data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through December 31, 2009.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%.

The incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose CT group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.23). There were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT screening of 20.0% (95% CI, 6.8 to 26.7; P=0.004). The rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose CT group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6; P=0.02).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Screening with the use of low-dose CT reduces mortality from lung cancer.

  abstract={Pathologies systematically induce morphological changes, thus providing a major but yet insufficiently quantified source of observables for diagnosis. The study develops a predictive model of the pathological states based on morphological features (3D-morphomics) on Computed Tomography (CT) volumes. A complete workflow for mesh extraction and simplification of an organ's surface is developed, and coupled with an automatic extraction of morphological features given by the distribution of mean curvature and mesh energy. An XGBoost supervised classifier is then trained and tested on the 3D-morphomics to predict the pathological states. This framework is applied to the prediction of the malignancy of lung's nodules. On a subset of NLST database with malignancy confirmed biopsy, using 3D-morphomics only, the classification model of lung nodules into malignant vs. benign achieves 0.964 of AUC. Three other sets of classical features are trained and tested, (1) clinical relevant features gives an AUC of 0.58, (2) 111 radiomics gives an AUC of 0.976, (3) radiologist ground truth (GT) containing the nodule size, attenuation and spiculation qualitative annotations gives an AUC of 0.979. We also test the Brock model and obtain an AUC of 0.826. Combining 3D-morphomics and radiomics features achieves state-of-the-art results with an AUC of 0.978 where the 3D-morphomics have some of the highest predictive powers. As a validation on a public independent cohort, models are applied to the LIDC dataset, the 3D-morphomics achieves an AUC of 0.906 and the 3D-morphomics+radiomics achieves an AUC of 0.958, which ranks second in the challenge among deep models. It establishes the curvature distributions as efficient features for predicting lung nodule malignancy and a new method that can be applied directly to arbitrary computer aided diagnosis task.},

              for the purpose of nodule classification in chest computed
              tomography scanning. METHODS: Three features based on (i) Gabor
              filter, (ii) multi-resolution local binary pattern (LBP) texture
              features and (iii) signed distance fused with LBP which generates
              a combinational shape and texture feature are utilized to provide
              feature descriptors of malignant and benign nodules and
              non-nodule regions of interest. Support vector machines (SVMs)
              and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers in serial and two-tier
              cascade frameworks are optimized and analyzed for optimal
              classification results of nodules. RESULTS: A total of 1191
              nodule and non-nodule samples from the Lung Image Data Consortium
              database is used for analysis. Classification using SVM and kNN
              classifiers is examined. The classification results from the
              two-tier cascade SVM using Gabor features showed overall better
              results for identifying non-nodules, malignant and benign nodules

               detection in the early stage is very important and challenging.
               This manuscript proposes a new computer-aided diagnosis system
               for lung cancer diagnosis from chest computed tomography scans.
               The proposed system extracts two different kinds of features,
               namely, appearance features and shape features. For the
               appearance features, a Histogram of oriented gradients, a
               Multi-view analytical Local Binary Pattern, and a Markov Gibbs
               Random Field are developed to give a good description of the
               lung nodule texture, which is one of the main distinguishing
               characteristics between benign and malignant nodules. For the
               shape features, Multi-view Peripheral Sum Curvature Scale Space,
               Spherical Harmonics Expansion, and a group of some fundamental
               morphological features are implemented to describe the outer
               contour complexity of the nodules, which is main factor in lung
               nodule diagnosis. Each feature is fed into a stacked
               auto-encoder followed by a soft-max classifier to generate the
               initial malignancy probability. Finally, all these probabilities
               are combined together and fed to the last network to give the
               final diagnosis. The system is validated using 727 nodules which
               are subset from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC)
               dataset. The system shows very high performance measures and
               achieves 92.55\%, 91.70\%, and 93.40\% for the accuracy,
               sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. This high
               performance shows the ability of the system to distinguish
               between the malignant and benign nodules precisely.",

  abstract={Background and Objective Lung cancer is an important cause of death and morbidity around the world. Two of the primary computed tomography (CT) imaging markers that can be used to differentiate malignant and benign lung nodules are the inhomogeneity of the nodules’ texture and nodular morphology. The objective of this paper is to present a new model that can capture the inhomogeneity of the detected lung nodules as well as their morphology. Methods We modified the local ternary pattern to use three different levels (instead of two) and a new pattern identification algorithm to capture the nodule’s inhomogeneity and morphology in a more accurate and flexible way. This modification aims to address the wide Hounsfield unit value range of the detected nodules which decreases the ability of the traditional local binary/ternary pattern to accurately classify nodules’ inhomogeneity. The cut-off values defining these three levels of the novel technique are estimated empirically from the training data. Subsequently, the extracted imaging markers are fed to a hyper-tuned stacked generalization-based classification architecture to classify the nodules as malignant or benign. The proposed system was evaluated on in vivo datasets of 679 CT scans (364 malignant nodules and 315 benign nodules) from the benchmark Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and an external dataset of 100 CT scans (50 malignant and 50 benign). The performance of the classifier was quantitatively assessed using a Leave-one-out cross-validation approach and externally validated using the unseen external dataset based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results The overall accuracy of the system is 96.17% with 97.14% sensitivity and 95.33% specificity. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.98, which highlights the robustness of the system. Using the unseen external dataset for validating the system led to consistent results showing the generalization abilities of the proposed approach. Moreover, applying the original local binary/ternary pattern or using other classification structures achieved inferior performance when compared against the proposed approach. Conclusions These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model as a novel tool to assist physicians and radiologists for lung nodules’ early assessment based on the new comprehensive imaging markers.},

  abstract = {The separation of malignant from benign lung nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) is important for the early detection of lung cancer, since early detection and management offer the best chance for cure. Although deep learning methods have recently produced a marked improvement in image classification there are still challenges as these methods contain myriad parameters and require large-scale training sets that are not usually available for most routine medical imaging studies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for lung nodule classification that fuses the texture, shape and deep model-learned information (Fuse-TSD) at the decision level. This algorithm employs a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture descriptor, a Fourier shape descriptor to characterize the heterogeneity of nodules and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to automatically learn the feature representation of nodules on a slice-by-slice basis. It trains an AdaBoosted back propagation neural network (BPNN) using each feature type and fuses the decisions made by three classifiers to differentiate nodules. We evaluated this algorithm against three approaches on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. When the nodules with a composite malignancy rate 3 were discarded, regarded as benign or regarded as malignant, our Fuse-TSD algorithm achieved an AUC of 96.65%, 94.45% and 81.24%, respectively, which was substantially higher than the AUC obtained by other approaches.}

              performance of the traditional radiomics model, deep learning
              radiomics model, and the fusion models in evaluating breast
              cancer ALN status based on dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic
              resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
              handcrafted radiomics features and deep features were extracted
              from 3062 DCE-MRI images. The feature selection was performed by
              applying mutual information and feature recursive elimination
              algorithms. The traditional radiomics model and deep learning
              radiomics model were built using the optimal features and machine
              learning classifiers, respectively. The fusion models for
              distinguishing axillary lymph node status were constructed using
              two fusion strategies. The performance of the models with
              MRI-reported lymphadenopathy or suspicious nodes to evaluate
              axillary lymph node status was also compared. RESULTS: The
              decision fusion model, with the integration of the radiomics
              features and deep learning features at the decision level,
              achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95\% confidence

              traditional radiomics model and deep learning radiomics model.
              The results of the decision fusion model with clinical
              characteristic yielded an AUC of 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.899-0.951),
              which was also superior to other models incorporating clinical

Accurate diagnosis of benign and malignant lung nodules is crucial for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. However, traditional methods of manually designed features face challenges in extracting and analyzing deep-level features using mathematical models. Meanwhile, methods using convolutional neural networks can extract deep-level features, but lack interpretability and are not as effective as manually designed feature methods for shallow visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a lung nodule classification method that combines shallow visual and deep learning features. We construct shallow visual and deep learning networks to extract and classify shallow visual features and deep learning features, respectively. Finally, we use a multi-model fusion strategy to achieve benign and malignant classification of lung nodules. In particular, we employ a neural network architecture search to build a deep learning network with better interpretability and performance. We conducted extensive experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and compared our method with the state-of-the-art research. Our results show that our method outperforms existing methods with an accuracy and F1 score of 91.21% and 91.04, respectively. demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our algorithm.},

abstract = {Numerous publications and commercial systems are available that deal with automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic computed tomography scans, but a comparative study where many systems are applied to the same data set has not yet been performed. This paper introduces ANODE09 ( http://anode09.isi.uu.nl), a database of 55 scans from a lung cancer screening program and a web-based framework for objective evaluation of nodule detection algorithms. Any team can upload results to facilitate benchmarking. The performance of six algorithms for which results are available are compared; five from academic groups and one commercially available system. A method to combine the output of multiple systems is proposed. Results show a substantial performance difference between algorithms, and demonstrate that combining the output of algorithms leads to marked performance improvements.}

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to describe the LUNGx Challenge for the computerized classification of lung nodules on diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans as benign or malignant and report the performance of participants’ computerized methods along with that of six radiologists who participated in an observer study performing the same Challenge task on the same dataset. The Challenge provided sets of calibration and testing scans, established a performance assessment process, and created an infrastructure for case dissemination and result submission. Ten groups applied their own methods to 73 lung nodules (37 benign and 36 malignant) that were selected to achieve approximate size matching between the two cohorts. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for these methods ranged from 0.50 to 0.68; only three methods performed statistically better than random guessing. The radiologists’ AUC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.85; three radiologists performed statistically better than the best-performing computer method. The LUNGx Challenge compared the performance of computerized methods in the task of differentiating benign from malignant lung nodules on CT scans, placed in the context of the performance of radiologists on the same task. The continued public availability of the Challenge cases will provide a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community.},

abstract={Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers, and early detection can improve survival rates. In the recent years, low-dose CT has been widely used to detect lung cancer. However, the diagnosis is limited by the subjective experience of doctors. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to use convolutional neural network to realize the benign and malignant classification of pulmonary nodules in CT images. We collected 1004 cases of pulmonary nodules from LIDC-IDRI dataset, among which 554 cases were benign and 450 cases were malignant. According to the doctors' annotates on the center coordinates of the nodules, two 3D CT image patches of pulmonary nodules with different scales were extracted. In this study, our work focuses on two aspects. Firstly, we constructed a multi-stream multi-task network (MSMT), which combined multi-scale feature with multi-attribute classification for the first time, and applied it to the classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Secondly, we proposed a new loss function to balance the relationship between different attributes. The final experimental results showed that our model was effective compared with the same type of study. The area under ROC curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.979, 93.92{\%}, 92.60{\%}, and 96.25{\%}, respectively.},
