## Directory Structure

The `config` directory includes the following files and subdirectories:

- **`data.yaml`**: Contains configuration settings for data loading, such as file paths, preprocessing options, and data splits.
- **`metadata.yaml`**: Defines metadata information, including dataset descriptions, feature details, and labels.
- **`experiment/`**: A subdirectory that holds configuration files for various experiments. Each file corresponds to a specific experiment setup, detailing parameters like model architecture, hyperparameters, and training options.

## Purpose

The `config` directory centralizes all configuration-related information, making it easier to manage and modify settings without altering the core codebase. This modular approach enhances maintainability and promotes reproducibility across different experiments and workflows.
